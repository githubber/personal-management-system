<h1 align="center"> Personal Management System</h1>
<p align="center"><i>Your central point for managing personal data <br> (if current modules allow).</i></p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<hr>
<p align="justify">
	It is easier to understand this web application when you think about a CMS (WordPress) or a CRM (SugarCRM), as the logic behind this web app is very similar to those two. My PMS may offer less possibilities than a cms or crm, but it does just what I want it to do. Besides, writing extensions is not so hard, depending on the underlying logic. Anyone with proper development knowledge can write their own extensions for personal needs.
</p>

<h3>Reasoning/Purpose</h3>
<hr>

<p align="justify">
    I decided to create my own system because, first of all, playing around with tons of plugins for WordPress and customizing existing CRMs would take me as much time as writing my own system. It's easier for me to write extensions and add additional modules, whichever I just need, if I write my own app, thereby already being familair with the underlying logic.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Second of all, there is no current system like that, and I did not want to end up integrating  a docker-based cloud with a CMS. Furthermore I just need a web app to keep organized, and I'm tired of having personal data on OneDrive, and on Google's cloud. Some notes here, some notes there. The end goal is having a web app running on terminal or a Raspberry 24/7 plugged into a home network, without internet access.

<h3>Available options and modules</h3>

<ol>
    <li><b style="display:inline">üéØ Goals</b> - <span align="justify"><i>Keep a track of Your personal goals. You can use todolist to keep track of Your goals progress or use payments submodule to keep an eye of the money amount that You want to collect for something.</i>

        <li><b>üìñ Notes</b> <span align="justify"> - <i>Add any personal note to desired category.

<h2>Support</h2>

<p align="justify">
    I cannot guarantee support. I've got a job, personal things etc, I'm just sharing my code/my application as MIT. However feel totally free to ask about something, write issues etc. As mentioned I'm using and I will use this application from now on daily so there might be some changes even good for me.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    As I'm working on it there will be some fixes, and new modules in future when I reach the point when I got all I need. So after reaching my goal I could handle some support requests if anyone will be interested.
</p>

<h3>Browsers Support</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Chrome</li>
</ul>

<p>
	I mean for real. Just <b>Chrome</b>. I know about bug with copying password in Firefox for example. But I just do everything in Chrome so I'm not really planning to check that on other browsers.
